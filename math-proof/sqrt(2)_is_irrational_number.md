##### √2 is irraltion number(Proof By Contradiction)
<br/>
Suppose √2 is element of **Q**   
,then a,b are coprime √2 = a/b  
<br/>

2 = a^2 / b^2  
2(b^2) = a^2

a^2 is even => a is even.
(Sup/ a is odd a = 2n+1, a^2 = 4n^2+4n+1  is odd -><- )<br/>
a = 2k, then 2(b^2) = 4k^2<br/>
b^2 = 2k^2> b is even.  
<br/>
a, b are even -><- (a,b coprime).
